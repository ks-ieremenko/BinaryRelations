# Binary Relations

---

## Description 
Analyzing binary relation(BR) to discover it's properties: **reflexivity, irreflexivity, symmetry, antisymmetry, asymmetry, transitivity**. 
All the calculations are done through the binary matrix. 

Displayed on the form:
- BR
- Domain - **D(R)**
- Range of the BR - **E(R)**
- Union of domain and range of BR - **O(R)**
- Matrix of BR **B**
- Square matrix **K=B*B**
- Properties
